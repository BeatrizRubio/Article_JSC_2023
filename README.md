In [Polynomial_bases_Schur](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_JSC_2023/tree/main/Polynomial_bases_Schur)  Schur polynomials are used to provide a bidiagonal decomposition of polynomial collocation matrices. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in

are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica.

The implementation uses Matlab 2022b and Wolfram Mathematica.
