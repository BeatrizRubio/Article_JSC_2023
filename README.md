DÃ­az, P., Mainar, E. & Rubio, B. Polynomial Total Positivity and High Relative Accuracy Through Schur Polynomials. J Sci Comput 97, 10 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-023-02323-1

In [Gram_Bernstein](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/Gram_Bernstein  Schur polynomials are used to provide a bidiagonal decomposition of polynomial collocation matrices. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica.

The implementation uses Matlab 2022b and Wolfram Mathematica.
